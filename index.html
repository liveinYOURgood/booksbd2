      <h3 class="yellowTitleBar">Five Recommended Reads from Bill Doyle...</h3>

      <h1 class="bodytextTESTINDEX">People may not know this but I like to read and my favorite types of books are autobiographies. The five listed below are some of my favorites. If I had to rank these books, they are all number one! Each one tells an interesting story that can be enjoyed by the public. They all are all great in their own way! So if you care to read a great book and have the time, without question, all these books are a true page turner.  From Mr. T. (from the Rocky 3 Movie and the A-Team TV show) to Mr. Rogers (from his very successful kids television show), it will be ok that your tv is turned off as your true imagination will be turned on! Enjoy!
